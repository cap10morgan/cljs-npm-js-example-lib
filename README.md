# cljs-npm-js-example-lib

This library exists to explore and demonstrate modern (as of 2020) ClojureScript
library development using tools-deps, :target :bundle, and integration w/
NPM-sourced JS dependencies.

It uses my helper tool [target-bundle-libs](https://github.com/cap10morgan/target-bundle-libs)
to generate its `src/deps.cljs` from the `package.json` file.
